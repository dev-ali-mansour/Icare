## 🧩 Architecture

- **MVVM** (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Clean Architecture**
    - Presentation: `ViewModel`s + Composables
    - Domain: `UseCase`s + `Model`s
    - Data: `Repositories` + Room DB + Remote APIs

---

## 🧪 Use Cases Implemented

Each ViewModel corresponds to domain-specific use cases, such as:

- `AddNewClinic`, `UpdateClinic`, `ListClinics`
- `AddNewDoctor`, `UpdateDoctor`, `GetDoctorSchedule`
- `SignInWithGoogle`, `Register`, `DeleteAccount`
- `AddNewPharmacist`, `ListPharmacies`, `UpdatePharmacy`
- etc.

Activity diagrams and PlantUML files for use cases are available in `/docs/diagrams`.

---

## 🗂️ ViewModels Covered

Simplified UML class diagrams are created to focus on the interaction between ViewModels and Domain
Models. These include:

- `AuthViewModel`
- `AppointmentViewModel`
- `ClinicViewModel`
- `CenterViewModel`
- `PharmacyViewModel`
- and more...

Each ViewModel exposes functions that interact with UseCases and hold UI state.

---

## 📊 Diagrams

- ✅ UML Class Diagrams (Models + ViewModels)
- ✅ Activity Diagrams for Use Cases
- ✅ Component Diagram of the System
- PlantUML files are maintained under `/docs/diagrams/`.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Koin** for Dependency Injection
- **Room** for local persistence
- **Coroutines & Flow**
- **Firebase Auth** for secure login
- **KSP/Annotation processing** for compile-time wiring
- **DrawIo** for diagram modeling

---

## 📌 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**: Encrypted auth flow, input validation, and account deletion.
- **Performance**: Lazy UI loading, state caching, and coroutine-optimized async operations.
- **Scalability**: Modularization and clean architecture allow scaling across teams/features.
- **Maintainability**: Strict adherence to Clean Architecture and MVVM patterns.
- **Availability**: Offline support using local Room DB with remote fallback.
